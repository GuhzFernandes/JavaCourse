# Java Learning Repository

This repository contains my personal learning journey with Java, where I reinforce concepts and explore them in more depth!  
Based primarily on the [**"Complete Java Developer Course – Mastering Java from Zero"**](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-java-developer-course-mastering-java-from-zero/) (Udemy), along with additional exercises and experiments created to reinforce concepts where needed.

## 📚 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to consolidate core and advanced Java knowledge through hands-on practice. Rather than strictly following a lesson-by-lesson structure, the focus here is on **understanding concepts**, **applying them in code**, and **building a solid foundation as a Java developer**.

Some exercises may be skipped, adapted, or extended, and new ones may be added whenever extra practice is useful.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

This repository explores a broad range of Java-related concepts, including but not limited to:

### Core Java & Language Features
- Java syntax and fundamentals  
- Variables, data types, operators, and control flow  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Classes and objects  
  - Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction  
  - Interfaces and abstract classes  
- Packages and access modifiers  

### Advanced Language Concepts
- Collections Framework and data structures  
- Generics and type safety  
- Exception handling and error management  
- Input/Output (I/O) and file handling  
- Functional programming concepts
  - Lambda expressions  
  - Streams and method references  

### Software Design & Architecture
- SOLID principles  
- Clean Code and readability  
- Design patterns
  - Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns  
  - Practical use cases and implementation examples  
- Composition vs inheritance  
- Loose coupling and high cohesion  

### Problem Solving & Best Practices
- Algorithmic thinking and logical problem-solving  
- Refactoring and code improvement  
- Debugging techniques  
- Writing maintainable and extensible code  
- Understanding trade-offs in design decisions  

## 🛠 Repository Organization

This repository is organized by **concepts and practice domains**, not by lessons or chapters.  
It may include:
- Exercises and coding challenges  
- Concept-driven examples  
- Experimental implementations  
- Iterative improvements and refactors  

This structure allows freedom to skip, extend, or add content as learning progresses.

## 🚀 Notes

- This is a **learning-oriented repository**, not a production system.
- Code style and structure evolve as skills improve.
- Some implementations may intentionally prioritize clarity over optimization.

## 📌 Disclaimer

This repository is intended for educational purposes only and does not reproduce or redistribute any paid course material. All code is written independently as part of the learning process.

Happy coding! ☕🚀
